## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This project uses Transformers to Analyze whether a Tweet is Positive or Negative.
---
ü§ó Transformers provides APIs and tools to easily download and train state-of-the-art pretrained models. Using pretrained models can reduce your compute costs, carbon footprint, and save you the time and resources required to train a model from scratch. These models support common tasks in different modalities, such as:
- üìù Natural Language Processing: text classification, named entity recognition, question answering, language modeling, summarization, translation, multiple choice, and text generation.
- üñºÔ∏è Computer Vision: image classification, object detection, and segmentation.
- üó£Ô∏è Audio: automatic speech recognition and audio classification.
- üêô Multimodal: table question answering, optical character recognition, information extraction from scanned documents, video classification, and visual question answering.
